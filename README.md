Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard':
```

The user can keep guessing the number until their attempts run out
```
You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 12
Too low.

You have 9 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 90
Too high.
```
```
You got it! The answer was 52.
```

If the user successfully guess the number, a winner notification will be displayed. Else, a game over notification will be dieplayed.
```
You got it! The answer was 52.
```
```
You've run out of guesses, you lose.
```
